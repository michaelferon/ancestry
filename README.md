# Feron Family Ancestry

This is my first go around with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and this repo is mostly an exercise in just that, combined with some standard unsupervised learning techniques applied to my family's geneological data.

The website is deployed through `GitHub Pages`, which you can see [here](https://michaelferon.github.io/ancestry/ "Feron Family Ancestry"). All the website source code is in the [docs folder](docs/).
